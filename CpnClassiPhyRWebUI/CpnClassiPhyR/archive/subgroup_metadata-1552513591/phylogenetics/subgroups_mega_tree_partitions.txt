; Bootstrap partitions and frequencies are shown below.
; Each partition is described by a string consisting of 0's and 1's
; where the nth character in the partition string represents the
; nth sequence in the input data. For a given partition, all sequences
; represented by a 1 cluster together and all sequences represented by
; a 0 cluster together.
; The frequency indicates the proportion of bootstrap replicates
; that give the same partition of sequences.
; Any partitions whose frequency was less than the frequency
; cutoff value have been excluded from these results.
